# Fetch Form

## Description

A basic website with a user creation form that takes in the required inputs:

Full Name,
Email,
Password,
Occupation,
State

| Field         | Required | Validation                                              |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name          | Yes      | Alphabetical Only                                       |
| Email         | Yes      | Alphabetical@Aphabetical.Aphabetical                    |
| Password      | Yes      | Numbers, Alphabet, Symbols                              |
| Occupation    | Yes      | Numbers, Alphabet                                       |
| State         | Yes      | Dropdown                                                |

In other words, for the Name field it should have validation that ensures that it is only made up of letters, the Company email is a string of letters followed by an @ followed by a string of letters, a period, and another string of letters.
